# Introduction

This repository contains the code for the Peoophole Optimizer contest done in my compiler class ([COMP520](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs520/2020/)) at McGill University during Winter 2020. The purpose of the project is to optimize the Jasmin code generated by the compiler through the use of pattern replacement. My implementation resulted in a 30.4% decrease in the generated code size which allowed me to secure the first place in the contest. More information can be found [here](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs520/2020/assignments/Peephole.pdf).
